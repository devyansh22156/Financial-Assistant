# üí∏ Financial Risk Prediction

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of a machine learning-based approach to predict financial risk. The aim is to empower individuals with insights into their financial health, promoting smarter financial decisions and overall well-being.

## üìå Overview

Financial literacy is crucial in today‚Äôs economy. This project proposes a user-friendly tool to assess financial risk using machine learning. The system analyzes user-provided financial and demographic data to categorize individuals into risk classes (low, medium, high), allowing early intervention and better planning.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `models/`: Contains trained models and scripts for Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP, and SVM.
- `preprocessing/`: Code for handling missing values, encoding categorical data, feature scaling, and SMOTE for class balancing.
- `app/`: A Flask-based web application for real-time predictions.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks used for model training, evaluation, and result visualization.
- `data/`: The Financial Risk Assessment dataset (not included due to privacy).

## üìä Dataset

The dataset includes financial and demographic features:
- Income
- Credit Score
- Loan Amount
- Asset Value
- Dependents
- Previous Defaults
- Gender, Marital Status, Education, etc.

**Preprocessing Techniques Used:**
- Missing value imputation using median.
- Label encoding for categorical variables.
- SMOTE for class balancing.
- Feature normalization via `StandardScaler`.

## üß† Models Used

| Model               | Key Features                                                     |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Decision Tree       | Easy to interpret, but prone to overfitting                      |
| Random Forest       | Ensemble of trees, reduced overfitting, better accuracy          |
| XGBoost             | High performance with regularization and boosting                |
| Voting Classifier   | Combines above models for improved stability                     |
| MLP (Neural Net)    | Captures non-linear patterns, needs more data                    |
| SVM                 | Effective in high-dimensional space, sensitive to noise          |
